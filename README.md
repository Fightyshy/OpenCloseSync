A small Java program for the purpose of downloading/uploading files between Google Drive from desktop programs that do not have the ability to do so be default.

Currently allows for single files to be downloaded/uploaded, with a program immediately opening the file on download, or optionally closing the file on upload.

Selection of files and folders on the Google Drive is done through basic 2 character CLI commands.
